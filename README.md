# Frag-AF
A trained clustering model in discovering small inhibitory peptide binders, also known as dominant negative fragments, for a high throughput method in understanding protein function. 

## Abstract
Peptide tiling is a method in which small segments of a protein interactor are screened to identify fragments capable of exterting a regulatory function, for instance, inhibition. One of the challenges of this approach is that-- due to the vast size fo the protein sequence space-- screening large libraries of fragments for potentital interactors are often prohibitively costly in terms of time and resources. New protein structure prediction technologies, such as Google DeepMind's Alphafold, have the potential to decrease experimental hurdles by allowing researchers to focus on highly confident interacting areas. 

In this study, we developed a trained classifing model in discovering dominant negative fragments, and tested the model with metabolic proteins.
